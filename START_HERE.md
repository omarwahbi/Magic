# ðŸŽ‰ Refactoring Complete!

Your Balance Updater application has been successfully refactored into a professional, modular architecture.

## Quick Start

### 1. Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd C:\Users\Omar\Desktop\magic
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python run_app.py
```

**Important:** Always run from the project root, not from inside the `src/` folder!

## What Changed?

### Before
- **1 file** (semi_auto_balance_gui.py) with 526 lines
- Everything mixed together

### After
- **24 modular files** organized by responsibility
- **100% functionality preserved** - works exactly the same!

## New Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Settings and configuration
