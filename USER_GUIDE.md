- May be correct (legitimate continuation) or incorrect (missing header)

**Solution:**
1. Review the warning messages in log file
2. Check if the medicine name matches the national code
3. If wrong, manually correct in results before saving
4. Consider fixing the PDF source if possible

3. **Verify cross-page items**: Check warnings for items at page boundaries
4. **Export unmatched codes**: Review and add to master Excel for future
5. **Manual review**: Check a few matched items manually to verify accuracy
6. **Keep Excel updated**: Regularly add new medicines from unmatched exports
7. **PDF quality matters**: Clean, properly formatted PDFs = better extraction
