## ⚙️ Alternative Build Methods

### Method 1: Using Python Script
```bash
python build_executable.py
```

### Method 2: Using Batch File (Recommended)
```bash
build.bat
```

### Method 3: Manual Command
```bash
pip install pyinstaller

pyinstaller --name=BalanceUpdater ^
            --onefile ^
            --windowed ^
            --add-data="src;src" ^
            run_app.py
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Locally (On Your PC)
```bash
cd dist
BalanceUpdater.exe
```

### Test on Another PC (Important!)
1. Copy `BalanceUpdater.exe` to a PC **WITHOUT Python**
2. Double-click the file
3. If it works → Success! Ready to distribute! ✅
4. If it doesn't → Check troubleshooting below

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "PyInstaller not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### Problem: Build fails with "Module not found"
**Solution:** Install dependencies first
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: Executable won't run on another PC
**Solution:** Rebuild with more hidden imports
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data="src;src" ^
            --hidden-import=pdfplumber ^
            --hidden-import=pdfplumber.utils ^
            --hidden-import=pandas ^
            --hidden-import=openpyxl ^
            --hidden-import=tkinter ^
            run_app.py
```

### Problem: Antivirus blocks the .exe
**Solution:**
- This is normal for PyInstaller executables
- Add exception in antivirus
- Or tell users to allow it (it's safe!)

### Problem: File size too large (>100 MB)
**Solution:** This is normal! You're including Python + all libraries
- 40-60 MB is expected
- You can compress with UPX if needed

## 📝 Build Options

### Single File (Recommended for Distribution)
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile run_app.py
```
- ✅ One file to share
- ❌ Slower startup

### Folder (Faster Startup)
```bash
pyinstaller --onedir run_app.py
```
- ✅ Faster startup
- ❌ Must share whole folder

### With Console (For Debugging)
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --console run_app.py
```
- ✅ See error messages
- Use for testing

### No Console (For Users)
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed run_app.py
```
- ✅ Clean, professional
- Use for distribution

---

## 🎨 Adding an Icon (Optional)

### Step 1: Get an Icon
- Create a `.ico` file (256x256 pixels)
- Or convert PNG to ICO: https://convertio.co/png-ico/
- Save as `icon.ico` in project folder

### Step 2: Build with Icon
```bash
pyinstaller --name=BalanceUpdater ^
            --onefile ^
            --windowed ^
            --icon=icon.ico ^
            --add-data="src;src" ^
            run_app.py
```

Now your .exe will have a custom icon!

## 📊 File Structure After Build

```
magic/
├── build/              ← Temporary build files (can delete)
├── dist/               ← YOUR EXECUTABLE IS HERE!
│   └── BalanceUpdater.exe
├── BalanceUpdater.spec ← Build configuration (can edit)
├── build.bat           ← Double-click to build
├── run_app.py          ← Original Python app
└── src/                ← Your source code
```

**The important file:** `dist/BalanceUpdater.exe`

## 💡 Tips

1. **Build in a clean environment** - Fewer packages = smaller file
2. **Test on another PC** - Always test where Python isn't installed
3. **Use --onefile** - Easier to distribute
4. **Add an icon** - Looks more professional
5. **Keep the .spec file** - Makes rebuilding faster

## 🚀 Ready to Build?

### Fastest Way:
1. Double-click `build.bat`
2. Wait ~30 seconds
3. Find your exe in `dist/` folder
4. Copy and share!

### That's it! 🎉

Your application is now a standalone Windows executable that works on any PC!
